Python Examples
===============
All operations which are supported by the command line tool can also be performed in a more modular sense from python. In fact, actions can be defined more broadly when using the python interface. The use of the commandline interface is therefore not strictly necessary. The following sections show python examples which illustrate this. The Jupyter notebooks, which are used to build these examples can be downloaded from `the github repository <https://github.com/strawpants/geoslurp/tree/master/docsrc/examples>`_.
