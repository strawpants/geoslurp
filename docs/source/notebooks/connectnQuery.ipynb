    "Internally, geoslurp uses the python sqlalchemy tools to establish a connection with the database. The information provided is therefore similar (hostname+port, username, password). This information can be provided directly to the constructor of [GeoslurpConnector](../references/geoslurp.db.html#geoslurp.db.connector.GeoslurpConnector). Alternatively, the convenience function [geoslurpConnect](../references/geoslurp.db.html#geoslurp.db.geoslurpdb.geoslurpConnect)  uses [local settings](../installation.html#local-configuration-settings)  from the file ``.geoslurp_lastused.yaml`` in the users's home. This has the advantage that possible sensitive information (logins, passwords) does not need to be stored in notebooks such as these.\n",
