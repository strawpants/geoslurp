# Download and manage datasets in a PostGreSQL database with the PostGIS
The idea is that this tool contains script to download (i.e. **slurp**) commonly used datasets and to register them in a postgresql+postgis database. This database can then be queried allowing the retrieval of the relevant data or datafiles. 

The main documentation lives at [geoslurp.wobbly.earth](https://geoslurp.wobbly.earth)

## Workings

The geoslurp module itself is a pure python module, which acts as a client. For this to work one needs to [set up a running PostGreSQL database](https://github.com/strawpants/docker-geoslurp).

## Change log V3
* Use python entry points to register datasets, views and functions (removes registration of user plugin directories)
* Move documentation to [https://readthedocs.org](https://geoslurp.wobbly.earth)
* Change github actions to pusblish and then release
* Work with SQAlchemy 2
* more (see commit messages)

## TODO's
* Move remaining 'orphaned' datasets to suitable python packages modules or include in the main package
* Improve this README
